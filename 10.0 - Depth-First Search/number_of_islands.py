Number of Islands

Given an m Ã— n grid consisting of 1s (land) and 0s (water), return the number 
of islands. An island is formed by connecting adjacent 1s vertically or horizontally.

Example:
Input:
grid = [
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","1","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The first island consists of the top-left 1s
- The second island consists of the middle 1
- The third island consists of the bottom-right 1s

Input:
grid = [
    ["1","1","0","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one connected island
